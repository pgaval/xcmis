The **xCMIS** project, initially contributed to the Open Source community by <a href='http://exoplatform.org'>eXo</a>, is an implementation of the full stack of Java-based CMIS services. xCMIS also include the client side frameworks for integrating content from different enterprise repositories according to the <a href='http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=cmis'>CMIS standard</a>.

OASIS's <a href='http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=cmis'>Content Management Interoperability Services </a> **CMIS** specification aims to standardize a Web services interface specification that will enable greater interoperability of Enterprise Content Management (ECM) systems.

xCMIS provides an out-of-the-box ability to expose an eXo JCR repository, and can be used in conjunction with CMIS gadgets using GWT based client side framework (coming soon to Open Source). Both can be easily integrated to the <a href='http://www.gatein.org'> GateIn portal </a>. To see full-featured CMIS gadgets in action, check out the demo on the <a href='http://xcmis.org'>xcmis.org</a> site.

xCMIS supports all the features specified in the CMIS core definition as well as both REST AtomPub and Web Services (SOAP/WSDL) protocol bindings. In addition to architecture supposed to provide an ability to a plug any third party content repository thanks to Storage Provider Interface layer.

So, the idea of the project is to make as simple as possible joining Enterprise Content repositories making all of them CMIS-able and expose them to language-independent CMIS clients using the most convenient protocol.

xCMIS project:

  * Is Packaged as J2EE Web archive ( <a href='http://code.google.com/p/xcmis/downloads/detail?name=xcmis-server-war-1.2.1.zip'>WAR</a> ) as well as prepared ["download and go"](http://code.google.com/p/xcmis/downloads/detail?name=xcmis-server-tomcat-1.2.1.zip) Tomcat bundle
  * Has a live demo with full-featured CMIS gadget on GateIn portal is accessible on the <a href='http://xcmis.org/CmisExpert1/org.exoplatform.cmis.CmisExpertApplication/CmisExpertApplication.html'>xcmis.org</a> site as well as with prepared ["download and go"](http://code.google.com/p/xcmis/downloads/detail?name=xcmis-server-tomcat-demo-1.2.1.zip) Tomcat bundle (the client is accessible as remote gadget)
  * Tested with third-party CMIS clients such as: IBM CMIS Firefox Connector and CMIS Spaces Flex+AIR client. Either local repository ( as described <a href='http://code.google.com/p/xcmis/wiki/xCMISthirdPartyClients'>here</a>) or http://xcmis.org/xcmis1/rest/cmisatom can be used as a CMIS repository's endpoint URL for these or other types of clients.

**04/28/2010 xCMIS 1.0 beta2 released.**

We are waiting for the official approval of CMIS 1.0 specs, so it is the latest, pre-final release of xCMIS. The main new features comparing to xCMIS 1.0 beta1 are:

  * It implemented according to Content Management Interoperability Services Version 1.0 Committee Draft 07 for REST AtomPub and Web Services (SOAP/WSDL) protocol bindings
  * Storage Provider Interface (SPI) for CMIS repository backend is finalized. It allows potentially any content storage be CMIS-able
  * <a href='http://code.google.com/p/xcmis/wiki/xCMISClientGwtRestAtom'> GWT CMIS client framework</a> decoupled from CMISExpert and joined to xCMIS codebase
  * The <a href='http://code.google.com/p/xcmis/wiki/xCMISConfigure'> configuration</a> is completely reworked, making possible to set different types of storages, indexes, rendition providers
  * <a href='http://code.google.com/p/xcmis/wiki/xCMISSearch'> Search engine </a> is decouped it from JCR storage (naturally as SPI is independent). Added support of multifiling and unfiling
  * xCMIS is no more tightly coupled with eXo (IoC) Container, deploying mechanism is pluggable
  * Added In-memory storage for both content and index, so now we have full featured, fast mechanism to test the binding internals
  * xCMIS can be bundled with stable GateIn 3.0 portal. Thanks to <a href='http://code.google.com/p/xcmis/wiki/xCMISGateInPortalExtension'>GateIn extension</a> bundle, added to the project's binaries it is possible to integrate xCMIS to the working portal.
  * xCMIS is tested under RestAtom TCK
  * You can access xCMIS along with other CMIS repositories on online <a href='http://gazarenkov.blogspot.com/2010/04/xcmis-in-aiim-cmis-demo-2010.html'> AIIM CMIS Demo </a>

  * Packaged as J2EE Web archive ( WAR ) as well as prepared "download and go" Tomcat bundle
  * Live demo with full-featured CMIS gadget on GateIn portal is accessible on the xcmis.org site as well as with prepared "download and go" Tomcat bundle (the client is accessible as remote gadget)

  * Tested with third-party CMIS clients such as: IBM CMIS Firefox Connector and CMIS Spaces Flex+AIR client. Either local repository ( as described here) or http://xcmis.org/rest/cmisatom can be used as a CMIS repository's endpoint URL for these or other types of clients.
